This DDE serves 2 purposes, one is to synchronize the prescription control state and the other is to enable a TC client to announce the support and initial state of its prescription control capabilities. Synchronisation by the prescription master (TC) is done by setting the prescription state of connected TC clients with a process data set value message with this DDE. It is recommended that TC clients reply their state immediately when such a message is received. The property flag 'setable' and the trigger method 'on change' shall be used with this DDE. The state 'manual/off' indicates that the device is in manual state and will ignore all prescription commands. The 'auto/on' state indicates that the client accepts the prescription commands as far as its overall process state allows.",

The TC shall active this trigger when using the DDI.\nSee attachment for more information",
			Comment: "In section control systems, the section control master and its clients need to be synchronized in terms of their general state or activation by the user (System activated/deactivated in individual setups). This DDE serves 2 purposes, one is to synchronize the section control state and the other is to enable a TC client to announce the support and initial state of its section control capabilities. Synchronisation by the section control master (TC) is done by setting the section control state of connected TC clients with a process data set value message with this DDE. It is recommended that TC clients reply their state immediately when such a message is received. The property flag 'setable' and the trigger method 'on change' should be used with this DDE. The state 'manual/off' indicates that the device is in manual state and will ignore all control commands for section control. The 'auto/on' state indicates that the client accepts the section control commands as far as its overall process state allows.",

			Description: "Element Type Instance",
			Definition: "This DDI is used to enumerate and identify multiple device elements (DET) of the same type within one Device Description object pool. The value of this DDI is independent of the DET number. The combination of device element type and value of Element Type Instance ETI represents a unique object inside the device description object pool and therefore shall exist only once per object pool. Recommendation: The definition of the device elements should be made from left to right direction or from front to back direction.  When in a matrix, count left-to-right first, then front-to-back and at last top-to-bottom. See attachment for more information.",
			Comment: "This DDE allows the system to communicate with a device element object independent of the device element number. The same tank of a seeder for instance could have various device element numbers based upon the DDD. The DDD structure may change during setup the implement. In this case a unique implement tank might has a different element number as before. Particular if the Task Controller (TC) use a user interface to display and change data by the operator. Therefore the TC needs clear or rather unique device element information. Assign this DDE for instance to a DET of type bin. This number can be displayed to the operator while it may be printed physically at the bin. The ETI number range from 0 to 65533 inside the object pool corresponds to a displayed value from 1 to 65534 on a user interface or physical device.",

			Description: "Actual Cultural Practice",
			Definition: "This DDI is used to define the current cultural practice which is performed by an individual device operation.

			Comment: "Implements as Planter or Seeder which provides more than one product application need an option to sign the cultural practice that is performed by each operation. More then ever if the applied products have the same unit type. As for instance a seeder provides a sowing and fertilizing operation which have both mass per area as unit defined. In this case it is not clear to the TC that the second operation is a fertilizing operation. Particular if the TC owns a user interface to display these information to the operator. Through this DDE the TC user interface can display the appropriate information. Adding this DDI to the device element of type device the main cultural practice of the device could be defined. For instance a baler will claim on the bus as forage device class and have set the actual cultural practice as baling.",

			Comment: "Depending on the application it might be required to know the distance of a device element down to the ground. All device element offsets refer to the DRP which is the centre of the device coordinate system and usually not at the ground surface. For instance the DRP of a tractor is the centre of the rear axle. In this case the distance from a GPS receiver (DET of type navigation reference) attached on the roof of the cab is calculated through sum up the Z-offset of the DET and the distance of the DRP to ground. The value of the DRP in this case is equivalent to the radius of the rolling wheel which is attached on the tractor rear axle.",

			Description: "Actual relative connector angle",
			Definition: "The DDI Actual relative connector angle shall be placed in the device element of type connector in the DDOP of the TC-SC Client. The value describes the actual angle of the longitudinal axis of the implement relative to the longitudinal axis of the tractor. This angle should be used by the TC-SC server to calculate the real position of implement. The TC-SC server may smooth the rendering in any proprietary screen. \nThe reference system is the coordinate system of the tractor. This results in the angles from table 1 of the attachment. \nIn case of for example a malfunction sensor the error value is set to 0xFExxxxxx.",
			Comment: "When working with Section Control it is necessary that the TC-Server calculates the exact position of the implement and its boom and sections to mark the covered area on its section control screen properly. To calculate the positions the TC-SC server uses the x and y offsets of the DRP and CRP. This works well for mounted and for non-steered trailed implements but comes up against limits when implements do have a steering axle or even a steering drawbar because the TC-SC server can’t know the current steering angle and moving the DRP doesn’t fit in all means. But this could be solved when the TC-SC server would knew the exact angle of the implement related to the tractor. This information could be provided by the implement because when they have a steering mechanism they even have a sensor to measure the angle between tractor and implement.",
